```java
public class GiveAdvice {
  // Be more creative with the one line comments
  // I couldn't be bothered..
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Programs can be easy or");
    System.out.println("difficult to read, depending");
    System.out.println("upon their format.");
    System.out.println();
    System.out.println("Everyone, including yourself,");
    System.out.println("will be happier if you choose");
    System.out.println("to format your programs.");
  }
}
```
