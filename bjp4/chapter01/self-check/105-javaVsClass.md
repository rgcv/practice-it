# BJP4 Self-Check 1.5: javaVsClass

> **What is the difference between the file MyProgram.java and the file
> MyProgram.class?**

1. .java file is a much larger binary file and a .class file is a smaller
   compressed version.
2. The programmer writes the .class file first, and the .java file is generated
   automatically later.
3. A .java file contains code written in the Java language, and a .class file
   contains code written in the C++ language.
4. **MyProgram.java is a source code file typed by the programmer, and
   MyProgram.class is a compiled executable class file that is run by the
   computer.** ✅
5. The .class file is for object-oriented programming and the .java file is for
   procedural programming.
