**NOTE:** BJP3 (Building Java Programs, 3rd Edition) problems are omitted since
they're deprecated and will soon be excluded from the problem set, effectively
being removed from the application.

**NOTE2:** Not including the JavaScript section, felt like it was out of place
amidst Java related problems. Incredibly out of place..
